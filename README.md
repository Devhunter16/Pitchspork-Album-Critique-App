# Pitchspork-Album-Rating-Express-App
Pitchspork album rating express app created using Node.JS, Express.JS, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Bootstrap.

Functionality to be implemented:

- Server-side form validation
- Sort options on each page (sort by: highest rating, by artist, etc.)
- Some pathing I have yet to get to
- Search bar functionality
- User authentication
- Editing code comments to make more sense to anyone reading the code
- Editing names of files to be more descriptive
